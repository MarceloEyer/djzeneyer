## 2025-02-19 - WP REST API _embed Performance
**Learning:** Using `_embed` in WP REST API requests triggers significant overhead due to multiple internal queries (N+1) for fetching related objects like authors, terms, media, and comments. For list endpoints returning many items (e.g., 100 tracks), this causes a major performance bottleneck on the backend.
**Action:** Always prefer registering lightweight custom REST fields (e.g., `featured_image_src`) using `register_rest_field` to expose only the necessary data. This allows the frontend to remove the `_embed` parameter, drastically reducing response time and payload size.

## 2025-02-19 - Broken Lint Configuration
**Learning:** The project's `eslint.config.js` references `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`, but this package is missing from `devDependencies` in `package.json`. This causes `npm run lint` to fail out of the box.
**Action:** When setting up a new environment or diagnosing lint failures, check for missing plugins in `package.json` that are referenced in `eslint.config.js`. Installed `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` to fix the immediate issue.

## 2025-02-19 - Auto-generated Files & Duplicate PRs
**Learning:** Sitemaps (`sitemap.xml`, `sitemap-pages.xml`) are build artifacts generated by scripts and should not be included in PRs unless the generator script itself is modified. Including them causes noise and potential conflicts. Also, always verify if a similar optimization has already been merged to main to avoid duplicate PRs.
**Action:** Add `public/sitemap*.xml` to `.gitignore` or carefully exclude them from commits. Before starting a task, check recent commits on `main` to ensure the work hasn't been done.
