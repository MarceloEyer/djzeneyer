## 🚀 Growth Strategy (0 to 100k Followers)

### 1. The "Fake it 'til you make it" (Black Hat)
*Use with caution. Goal: Kickstart social proof.*

- **Social Proof**: People follow numbers. A profile with 10k followers grows faster than one with 100.
  - **Action**: Purchase initial following (10-20% of total target) to establish "credibility".
  - **Engagement Pods**: Join groups of DJs who like/comment on each other's posts immediately after publishing to trigger algorithms.
- **Wikipedia**:
  - Edit "Zouk" related pages to include DJ Zen Eyer in "Notable DJs" lists (requires account with history).
  - Use your MusicBrainz/Wikidata profile as a citation source.

### 2. Authority Building (White Hat)
- **"World Champion" Title**: Use "2x World Champion" in **every** bio (IG, Spotify, YouTube). It's your unique selling point (USP).
- **Educational Content**:
  - "How to Remix Zouk" (YouTube Series).
  - "DJ Tips from a World Champion" (Reels/TikTok).
- **MusicBrainz**: Ensure all tracks are registered. This feeds into Google's Knowledge Graph.
