## Voice Search Notes

Pronunciation data on the official site helps search engines, LLMs, and knowledge systems disambiguate the entity. It does not by itself force Alexa or Amazon Music to resolve a voice command correctly. For Alexa, the artist mapping and searchable aliases inside Amazon Music/distributor metadata remain the primary control points.

When opening support tickets with distributors or Amazon Music, use:

- Canonical artist name: `Zen Eyer`
- Requested searchable alias: `DJ Zen Eyer`
- IPA: `/zɛn ˈaɪər/`

Note: `Zen Ayer` is simply a common misspelling that some people use.
